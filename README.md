# EasyPriority
Script that uses psutil to toggle processes on Windows OS without having to change each process spawned from a single application. 
  
Current state:
  1. The program runs from Tkinter, and has an EXE (inside of 'dist' folder)
  2. The program succesfully finds process and attempts to lower priority. May fail based on type of process (i.e windows system processes) 
  3. Works for Windows only
